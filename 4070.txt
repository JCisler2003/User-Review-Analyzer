The media could not be loaded.At first I’ll admit it was a slight pain to get it working correctly but realized it was a motherboard issue and bios needed an update but after that the card cools down pretty good and performs really well and definitely landing between 120-130fps range at max settings at 2560x1440p so definitely a damn good card for the priced compared to other more expensive options unless if you care about aesthetics then it’s not the greatest looking card and simple in design but well worth the buy for performance IMO 👍🏾Read more
