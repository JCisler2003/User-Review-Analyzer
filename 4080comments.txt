It requires three PCIe cables to get it to display anything.That being said. Graphics? Amazing. If you’re worried that it’s bad quality? Don’t be. I got this thinking i’d get a messed up GPU with broken fans because of some of these reviews.For 50 dollars less and for the same performance as all the other 4080 Supers you get a really good card capable of 4K 60fps Max Settings any game. Ray Tracing is phenomenal but basically requires DLSS on certain games which is fine. Doesn’t really degrade any of the quality and overall looks amazing. I mean… i literally got like 120 fps at 4k on ghost of tsushima. (With dlss on of course) but even with it off i got a steady 70.And note: support bracket isn’t required. The card is huge though.Read more

Ignore irrelevant phrases like "Read more" and "The media could not be loaded. Do not give any other comments." When it comes to the decision of power vs value, this is one of NVIDIA's crowning jewels when it comes to modern graphics cards. This GPU has it all- a large supply of VRAM, DLSS upscaling, Frame Generation, AV1 Encoding, near endless shader support, and much more. The GPU is also a colossally massive work of engineering that struggles to fit inside even the best of cases, but for those with the clearance, this GPU is near-perfectly balanced when it comes to value.Let me start by saying that if you are playing games at resolutions lower than 4K, you simply won't need another GPU for a very long time. On a pure rasterization standpoint, without any of the fancy DLSS features, I can run most modern and older titles at 4K medium to high settings all at 60FPS or higher, with most being over 100FPS. Once Ray Tracing is enabled, that number does dwarf substantially but can be quickly remedied by simply enabling DLSS upscaling and even Frame Generation in supported games. For those running 1440p, 1080p, or lower resolutions, it would be hard to find any game that will run lower than 100 FPS at Max Settings. Alan Wake 2, which is the most demanding game I own, runs at between 28-35 FPS at Max settings at 4K with Ray Tracing enabled, but that number jumps well over 60 when DLSS and Frame Gen are enabled. I mention that as that's the worst case scenario I've encountered, and even recently ported games from the PS5 such as Horizon: Forbidden West, Ghost of Tsushima, and God of War: Ragnarok all clear 100+ FPS at 4K Max Settings with DLSS enabled but no Frame Gen needed when paired with my 7800X3D. Plus, the GPU's massive heatsink and 3 large fans make this card rarely peak beyond 67 degrees when under load as it stays impressively cool despite all the power it uses. Needless to say, for gaming, there really isn't a need for anything better.However, that's not all. When it comes to encoding, this card delivers some of the best quality I have ever seen in my streams and videos. The AV1 encoder on this GPU makes my content look much less pixelated and with reduced artifacts compared to when I was still encoding on either x264 or NVENC settings. Additionally, the render times in some of my video editing applications are significantly reduced while still giving me that higher level of quality in my output.Now, the card itself is still quite large as mentioned, and it also uses the newer mini power connector that Nvidia introduced a few years ago. The GPU does include a 3 8-pin to 12+4pin adapter as well as a GPU stand, but the adapter was a bit too bulky for my case, so I did have to swap to a new power supply that had its own dedicated 12VHPWR cable for it to fit once my side glass panel was installed.On the software side, the NVIDIA app is a breeze to use, and drivers are also quick and effortless to install. The card seems to get incrementally faster with each polished update, and for the games that can support all the features it has to offer, it really is a masterclass in its own respect.Overall, with all the raw power this GPU provides, as well as support for DLSS upscaling and Frame Generation, this card will last through the test of time for even the most demanding games. While not quite as powerful as the 4090, which may give you a slight edge in Ray Tracing performance over this 4080 Super, for those who don't use RT features, there simply isn't anything better. I highly recommend it!Read more

Do not give any other comments." The card actually performs really well. It runs at like 30° idle with fans at the minimum of 30%. Really quiet at that temp and fan speed.It'd be great if that's all it did. As soon as I put it under any load the fans would revv wildly for a few seconds and spin down just as fast. Even when it wasn't hitting the temps I set for my fan curves. It ignored all fan curves completely.I tried MSI Afterburner and even tried the Velocity X from PNY themselves, neither worked. Not even a undervolt would get the fans to stop revving.Seems a few others are having the same issues with their cards. Maybe they aren't all bad and I just got a bad one but I wouldn't take my chances. I will be returning the card.Read more

Do not give any other comments." The title of this review says it all, pretty much. Despite the weird influx of negative reviews saying this card listing on amazon was overpriced, I purchased this card from amazon listed at the MSRP of $999.99. Please keep that in mind moving forward, as obviously my opinion on performance for a $1000 card would be different than on a $1150+ card with identical performance. After doing lots of research on this specific card, including reading lots of helpful teardown articles that detailed PNY's design choices, I can conclude that this is a great deal with few drawbacks (mostly preference).Firstly, I must say that this was a godsend when I was parts shopping for my most recent build, as I really desperately wanted an all black, no-rgb card with a very clean looking silhouette. A rare sight in today's market of Strix red and blue cards and all of the Decepticon-looking design choices made by a majority of vendors. PNY kept it classy and simple, and I have to give them points for that. The card is just as large as any other 3rd party 4080, at roughly 13 inches in length and requiring 3 gpu bracket slots in my case. The build is exceptional quality, with a hefty heatsink and metal backplate, as well as a slightly textured black finish on the GPU shroud.Unfortunately for some, the fans need to be set on a custom curve out of the box. If you are chasing a dead-quiet plug and play GPU, you might want to try your chances elsewhere. All of my case fans are nearly silent Arctic p12 and p14s, so its easy for me to see which one of my components is being noisy. It's really not a huge deal, as setting up a fan curve fixes it perfectly and only takes 2 minutes in afterburner. I'd also recommend undervolting this card for the fan noise reasons mentioned above. It's best to let this card stay cool, and from my benchmarks there is no performance hit, which is nice.There is no ability to go over the stock power limit! Meaning that in afterburner, you cannot set the limit to 10X%. It is going to be at 100% limit stock. This is a shocker, as PNY is one of the only vendors I've seen that did this, and I'm not sure why, or if they'll allow it in the future. As mentioned above, undervolting is beneficial regardless, but if you were looking to really push this card above and beyond in core overclocking, look elsewhere.Finally, a preference based drawback is there is NO RGB. Which is a plus for me, as I was exclusively shopping for cards that had little to no lighting areas so my all black ultra clean build could be cohesive. However, yes, there is no rainbow capability on PNY's GPU shroud. The only illumination is the PNY logo in a soft white color, which I don't mind. From what I can tell, there is no way to change the color of this logo unless you change the color of the physical LED. As you might be able to tell, I'm a little OCD about the all black, no-rgb theme, as I used to work professionally in graphic and web design, so color blocking and theme need to be as perfect as I can manage.It may seem like this card is a box of cons, however I really have to nitpick when it costs $1000. It really is a phenomenal card if you're looking to upgrade from the 20 series, or a mid-range 30 series card. The card is exactly as expected and performs like a 4080 Super should. I know it's controversial that a SUPER card is just marginally better than the original counterpart, but as someone who was close to buying a 4070 Ti Super because the og 4080 was too expensive, this card was an obvious choice. I try not to get caught up in hanging onto the "Super" advertising, as this card is ONLY a free $200 discount off of the original SKU.TL;DR - Buy this card if you want a 4080 at a more reasonable price and favor a clean, all black aesthetic for your next build. Set up a custom fan curve with MSI Afterburner and you'll be a happy customer.Read more

As it seems they are just there to deny claims no matter what. I sent in a card for RMA with whatever was wrong with the card in pictures and print, which they just denied it anyway.

I did require a bigger case to fit the GPU in but this enabled me to rebuild the system with the new gpu in mind.I am so pleased with its performance. Outstanding piece of kit. The RGB is always a nice finish to any gaming rig.I mainly play DCS (Digital Combat Simulator), in PCVR. Anyone who games, knows what extra power is required of any GPU when using PCVR, especially with the size of games coming out now a days.The step up in performance is amazing.Intially i had an issue with the system shutting down, but this was totally down to me not double checking on one of the pins on the PCI-E cables not being fully housed. Once i resolved that, it has been perfect. The customer services was really impressive. Very understanding and they gave me loads of feedback on trying to resolve the issue with me. I would definately recommend this company to anyone purchasing a new GPU. 10/10.Read more
