# CS-325-Project-1

# Description
This program uses the Phi 3 small language model to to answer user-generated prompts from a text file. The program extracts the question from the text file, processes it, and puts the answer into another text file called "answers.txt".

#Details
This program uses the transformers library and hugging face to handle the use of phi 3. When the program is first run, the program takes care of installing phi 3 locally before the program starts to read the prompts.

To use this program, make sure you have a python compiler, transformers and pytorch installed on your machine. Most compilers have a step-by-step guide on how to properly install them. Pytorch and transformers are installed using the pip program in the command prompt. After that, the program should work inside of vs code.
