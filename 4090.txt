I like the card. It's big, powerful and well made. That being said, I am tempted to give it a 1 star review simply because of my disgust at the ridiculous pricing. These companies really need  to be brought down a peg and get their greed under control because if I wasn't a major power user I would have refused to buy this card on principal. I needed it for work (rendering) so I sucked it up and it gets the job done. I strongly advise against buying this card if you aren't absolutely sure you need it though, because it's a complete waste to use it for gaming when there are far cheaper and more economical options even at maximum settings. Please don't feed the animals if you can help it! 😉
If you're here, you probably already know precisely what the 4090 is and does. Key takeaways for this TUF variant are that it performs as advertised, is very large and runs relatively cool. Replaced a 10GB 3080, hesitantly, to take full advantage of the 5k+ resolution of a new VR headset. The 3080 just didn't have the stomach for those resolutions. This card pushes 3300x3300 (per eye!) without breaking a sweat in the racing sims and roomscale experiences I've thrown at it. It's almost comical just how much memory and how powerful this GPU has and is.Things to be aware of:- Power requirement. You need 600W dedicated purely to this card if you want to make full use of its potential. That includes 4 SEPARATE dedicated 8-pin PCIe connectors running from your ATX 2.0 PSU's VGA/PCIe/CPU outputs to the 12VHPWR connector that comes with the card. Alternatively, newer ATX 3.0 PSUs come with the 12VHPWR standard, I believe. I went ahead and upgraded to a 1000w gold PSU. 850w minimum spec made me nervous with OC'd CPU and all other cards/USB devices considered.- It's huge. It's "check your available internal case dimensions" levels of huge. Specifically length and height (amount of PCIe slots) are the likely largest concerns, but if you have a slim case, you need to check that too.- It's heavy. Thankfully it comes with a support that works very well. Once in place, there is no concern about the load being put on the PCIe slot.- It can get noisy when hot enough for the fans to start ramping up. There is definitely a little coil whine, but I run my case fans relatively high to begin with and am not noticing it any more than I did with my TUF 3080. Those who like dead-silent systems may want to look elsewhere, but I really think the issue is overblown unless my experience is the exception.- It runs surprisingly cool, even with low fan speed. My case is not spacious, but I have not seen a rise in CPU, motherboard or RAM temps compared to having the 3080 in there.- It can easily outpace single-core performance on a majority of CPUs out there. Beware that any CPU bottlenecks will become immediately evident. I've noticed walls that didn't exist before since the GPU can now handle all display demands at 60% power when unoptimized/single-core heavy sims hit the wall with my aging 10700k at 5ghz.I feel a bit ridiculous being a proponent of an $1,800 GPU, but times have changed. 5k+ resolution HMDs now exist. Triple screen 4k performance is a real thing for others. I would not consider buying this GPU if it weren't for a very specific need of mine, but it's good to know that GPU performance will never be a concern in the foreseeable future and I can focus on eventually updating to a new socket, CPU and DDR5 when it becomes necessary.
Quick bullet pointsPROS: Looks great, sound levels are perfectly fine for the fan size, great performance, ease of installation, no issues with setup physically or driver wise. I run the latest Studio drivers and haven't had any issues.CONS: Pricing is high for all high-end card right now, and one like this could be as expensive (or more) than the rest of the computer combined. Supply and demand right, but hopefully this becomes a sub $2K card again at some point. Only other complaint is the power cable. This uses a 4 into 1 because of the massive power requirement. But the power plug comes straight out from the side, which is an issue for most of us with tower and the card being right-side up, as the cable hits the clear wall/door. This also forces the cable to be at a bad angle, with tension on it. I believe that this is where some of the plug issues came from. I bought a 90 degree adapter and I feel that is much more secure and stable. For a card with this configuration and cost, a 90 degree adapter should be included, as more people than not will require it.Final tip: USE the included stand. This card is heavy and bows the board and slot the moment that you insert it. I run two stands (one on each corner of the far side) and no zero issues. Also, this must be a large case, no minis or it will not fit.Final verdict: I would definitively buy again and if the cost is not prohibitive for you, I recommend it.
The media could not be loaded.I was genuinely excited about the ASUS ROG Strix GeForce RTX ™ 4090 White Edition Gaming Graphics Card, but unfortunately, the experience has been far from smooth. To its credit, the card manages most games with impressive efficiency. However, when I started using DisplayPort for 3D applications, I encountered significant difficulties.For some reason, the card fails to establish a successful DirectX 3D interlink with DisplayPort, which severely impacts shadow rendering in 3D programs. It’s not a cable issue either, as when I switch to HDMI, the problem doesn’t occur.The technical investigation points towards a possible incompatibility or glitch between the DisplayPort 1.4a, used by this card, and DirectX 3D rendering. What’s more, I also found that this issue prevents successful benchmarking of the computer. Every benchmark program I’ve tried encountered a DirectX 3D error, rendering them unusable.What has been most disappointing is the response, or rather, lack of response from ASUS. I’ve reached out to them about this significant issue, but they have not even acknowledged my concerns, let alone provided assistance.So, in conclusion, while this card might be a good fit for general gaming, the DisplayPort and DirectX 3D rendering issues, compounded by the inability to benchmark, significantly undermine its value, especially for those who work heavily with 3D applications or like to keep track of their PC’s performance. I, therefore, feel compelled to rate this product with a single star. ASUS, you’ve let us down on this one.
I'm upgrading from a ASUS ROG Strix 1080ti so I have very little frame of reference for performance for a modern 30/40 series Nvidia gpu, but from the few benchmarks I've run and the gaming tests I've done so far this card is beastly. It's going to sound stupid, but basically since Skyrim was released my go to metric for raw performance has been can it run ultra-modded Skyrim smoothly ("ultra-modded" has changed a lot over the years so the metric stayed relevant for me). Yes Skyrim is a 12 year old game, but when you get enough texture mods combined with an ENB and such it can be quite demanding. With my standard ultra-modded install I was getting like 40fps fairly consistently on the 1080ti but there were still dips in certain areas, this card is locked at a rock solid 60fps (capped due to engine limitations) and it's barely breaking a sweat, highest usage I saw was 51% usage in the most demanding spot I know to test ingame (would occasionally cause a crash even on the 1080ti and the 1080ti was constantly pinned at 100% usage). I swear I've never had such a jump in performance from a single upgrade, granted I skipped 2 generations this time, but even still. Time to go do an obligatory Cyberpunk playthrough with settings cranked I guess. To be clear I bought this card specifically for its AI performance and VRAM for locally running large language models and stable diffusion, but now I'm geeking out over the raw speed of this card so I guess some gaming is in order.Specifically regarding the ASUS TUF branding, it's a solid well built card. The metal shroud gives the card a lot of rigidity and the recessed 12vhpwr plug is nice for helping to avoid putting strain on the connector which has been a problem with other cards. This card is absolutely massive, so build accordingly. Their little support bracket to keep the card from sagging is a high quality machined aluminum part (although it barely fit above the tower basement in my Enthoo Evolv case even at its lowest setting). Thermals have been good so far, haven't seen it top 70 C yet at stock speeds. At stock the card pulls about 500W peak so make sure you have a beefy PSU.I'll be the first to say that if you're running a 1440p monitor (or lower) this card is absolutely overkill (probably my next upgrade) for gaming in basically any title, if you know you need this power for something specific, pick it up, but if not there are much better price/performance options.
What can be said about the 4090 that hasn't already been said? It's the most powerful graphics card on the market at a ridiculously high price. Despite the price, 4K high refresh rate gaming is finally here. For those privileged (or foolish depending on your resolution preference) to have a quality 4K high refresh monitor, nothing else from the competition will come close. I am a long time PC builder that specializes in custom loop water cooling and have used many other 4090 cards. When purchasing this model, I did not notice it was the OG edition which uses the previous generation's Asus Tuf 3090 TI PCB and cooler, likely for cost reasons (though this is not passed to the consumer) but also gives the card a slimmer profile than the regular 4090 Tuf cards. This is an important caveat for those wanting to liquid cool the card. EKWB, maker of premium GPU waterblocks confirmed their Tuf 3090 TI block IS compatible with this card but your mileage may vary with other Tuf 3090 TI blocks available. Outside of last gen EK blocks, a few Chinese manufacturers like Alphacool and Bykski offer compatible blocks but the pickings are slim. Luckily, Granzon a subsidiary of Bykski makes a gorgeous block for this card which I highly recommend. Another thing to note is the size of the card which is enormous and long like most 4090 cards are. I have a reasonbly large case (Phanteks Enthoo 719) and while waiting for the waterblock, the GPU would not fit either horizontally or on the vertical mount, conflicting with the resevior I am using. I ended up using a vertical slot near the front glass panel and the card stuck out of the case which blocked the tempered glass from closing. Even after installing the water block, there are only a few millimeters between the card and the reservoir so I will be case shopping when I change the rest of my personal rig soon. Cooling and clearance aside the card is still a beast and runs extremely cool and quiet both with stock cooling and watercooling. I have had zero coil whine which some of the other Tuf cards I have used (especially the 4090s) have suffered from. The OG OC has a small core overclock of 45MhZ and at least my card has about zero headroom over that. I was able to get a modest ÷85 on the core and +100 offset on memory. I am not sure how other OG OC cards fair at the silicon lottery and this may not be typical. Performance is on par with all but the highest end 4090s. Thankfully overclocking GPU is not necessary to get the most from demanding games! I replaced my FE 3090 with this card and despite using the 4090 before in builds for clients, I am consistently impressed by this card. As this card seems to be one of the more available cards close to MSRP, I suspect a lot of people will be considering this GPU. Recommending the this particular 4090 variant depends on various factors. If you're going to be watercooling this card look at available blocks before purchasing to make sure they will fit your rig and aesthetic. If there is an opportunity to buy a regular Tuf version or similar card I would simply for the waterblock options available. If you like the blocks available ( the Granzon block is incredible!) and it fits your needs, the card is great. If you are air-cooling, I wholeheartedly recommend this card if it's at MSRP.
The 4090 is incredible. We all know this. It is/was hands down the most powerful GPU of its generation but even then, it wasn't/isn't enough.This is getting 4 stars because of false or misleading advertising. The RTX 4090 is not a 4k 120 card, heck it's barely a 1440p 165hz card. If you don't like DLSS that is. I tried to like DLSS but it makes games look awful. For myself, it is unusable but if you don't use it, then the 4090 starts to pale in comparison to what was advertised.I expected 1440p 165hz stable, what a joke. not even close. AI upscaling is required for high-resolution recent framerates.that all being said, this card handles everything from the past just fine. Metro redux max settings 1440p I'm getting around 90 frames. Helldivers 2 I'm getting 90-120 frames.for the price and with what I was promised before purchasing, this GPU has been a letdown. I still love it and it's an incredible card, I just feel lied to. No buyer's remorse or anything, the thought of returning or selling it has never crossed my mind, it's just a letdown. IDK, it's the most expensive single object outside of a car I've ever purchased so I expected it to live up to its claims and I feel burned for buying into the hypeon a side note, my Asus Tuf 4090 OC is genuinely tough. My car was rear ended while I was moving and mu PC case was magled. massive size of the cooled ended up stopping the case from totalling collapsing in on itself. Every component was saved due the 4090s sheer girth. props asus, thank you for building them tuf haha
It's absolutely nerve-wracking ordering a gpu online, but I gotta say, this was the best order in every way. The seller was fantastic. They did not price gouge the card. This card is had to find in stores and they were priced right. They gave email and tracking number. It was fast shipping as well, projected 5 days and got it in 3. The box was original sealed and perfect, Numbers matching. The 4090 is as expected. I run it stock with no additional software or fan curves. I play everything on ultra and temps stay around 68c and fans at maybe 50%. So, great seller and great gpu. Total piece of mind, is always worth the little extra in price.
The presentation of the card was nice, the packaging was secure and the card didnt show any signs of damage. Unfortunately, my card does have coil wine which is loud enough to be heard while gaming. Unlucky and not ideal, but otherwise the card has worked fine thus far.
I'm very afraid. Could it be the dam AI? It seemed to find the slot and jumped right into it.  Even though it was the size of a 1973 Chrysler Newport. From a lifetime of past experience I figured, "Dam, this overpriced piece of stock option will never work". I hit the power switch and it fired up. I felt fear. No way is this going to keep working.  But it did. The drivers installed flawlwessly. Now I'm really scared. I started MSFS 2020.  It was a rhing of beauty.  I was listening to Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' at the time. Whether this had some kind of adverse effect, I'll never know.........Mother board: Asus prime x670e-pro wifi with Asus rtx 4090 with cooler.
I wish it was more clear what the OG OC stands for but for anyone wondering, it is a 4090 on a 3090 PCB. With that said it runs everything on fully maxed out settings with no issue and stays cool doing it. I haven't noticed any reason not to get it.
Admittedly, I did not get this GPU for gaming; the one game I play is so old that FPS hardly matters. I create 3D content, and that's where a large amount of memory comes into play. Coming from a 3080, the increase in memory and speed is night and day in terms of what the GPU can handle. It handles heat well. I installed the GPU tweak software provided by Asus to adjust the fans slightly, letting them run a bit while idle and stay cooler than the default 0dB setting when idle.In the past, I switched from GPU-based renderers to CPU while working in Houdini to keep large scenes or detailed simulations in memory during renders. Using my CPU brought other issues, and programs like the Unreal editor constantly flagged me for running out of GPU resources in heavily populated levels.Using the 4090, I rarely run out of memory with the Redshift and KarmaXPU engines. The Unreal editor now hardly bats an eye at tens of thousands of hi-poly instances during cinematic sequences. If you use Stable Diffusion, the increased memory also means generating much larger images without the typical memory constraint. If you are a fan of photogrammetry, it handles programs like Reality Capture or 3DF Zephyr incredibly well.Overall, I would not recommend this solely for gaming. It'll likely chew up any game for a while but is also likely overkill. This 4090 is the cream of the crop for content creators, 3D artists, and anyone else using heavier software for work.
Incredible performance boost from my Asus GTX 1080. My system is a crossover for Gaming / Business / Multi-Media, so I won't go into frame rates etc.The only thing I think needs to be covered is... that this is a REALLY BIG CARD. Measure your case. I just assumed it would fit and it did but... I had to make some modifications.This card was too thick for me to mount on a riser, even though my case had the horizontal mount for it. So, I have to install normally which ran into an issue with my AIO Liquid cooler. I had to remove one fan and order a slim fan to replace it because there was zero tolerance to install the card with the standard fan attached to the AIO (picture is before installing new fan).Being that Thermaltake uses a proprietary RGB data connector, I had to mix lighting effects using my motherboard's controller. In my case a new case would have led to a lot of other upgrades because I use optical drives for some of my multi-media work.So, check your measurements before buying.
This card is an absolute monster. I mean what else can be said? Cooling is pretty good. Has no issue staying under 41c at idle with the fans off, and under 60 at load with the fans at 70-75%. Stock configuration the card seems to consume anywhere from 280-320w while gaming. 15w at idle.Haven't heard any coil whine yet.
I ordered this GPU from another country, I was afraid it would arrive with damages but the product is so well packaged that it didn't arrived with a single scratch, the performance is amazing and it looks cool af.
Title says it all... purchase it.  Heck... buy two and have the family in one room for the winter.
Handles everything very well. No coil noise on mine.
There seems to be a wobble (imbalance ) on one of the three fans . I spent 2,000$ dollars on this and immediately am worried about the future replacement and fixing my GPU. I’m going to see if it continues or gets worse and update you. Seriously thinking about getting a replacement though because this is day one of opening. After doing a search I quickly found many ppl on Reddit and other social media asking about this with videos of the same thing i am describing. They sent it back got another that did the same thing so was thinking it was a manufacturing defect. However after looking on ASUS support site they said that it is normal for the high pitch noise due to increased amounts of electricity running thru it. We will see
I shouldn't have bought it. I shouldn't have bought it. I really shouldn't.But I did it anyways, and here comes the review (and confession)I have went through the crypto mining craze and bought my 3080 at scalper prices which I regretted a lot. With the recent changes in demand I know for sure the price for 4090 is gonna skyrocket, and I decided to take the bullet this time, at least at a cost not too far off from the MSRP.The card itself has great build quality, and is the heaviest card I have ever had. Compared with my flagship MSI Suprim 3080, it is like 30% larger. JUST ENOROMOUS. When I ordered it I thought no way my case wouldn't be able to fit, given it is a large mid-tower, but when it is actually fitted with the notorious 12VHPWR adapter there is too little space left to be comfortable.Anyways, this effectively DOUBLES the performance with 3080 at a similar power draw. The card stay relatively cool and quiet at all times. For those who fear for you know what (banging my head against wood), set the power limit to 80% and it would draw arounds 360W only, much more reasonable and you wouldn't lose more than 5% performance in benchmark and no more than a few frames in actual gaming, which is insignificant as it could push 100 frames+ in almost every situation.I am kind of glad that I am able to order it, and kind of regretful that I pulled the trigger. Well, at least I could now turn on all the eye candies to fill my empty stomach.
Built my first PC in about a decade or two, last one was windows XP. Mainly wanted to drive triple 42" 4k monitors for sim racing. Coupled this with a i9 13th gen cpu in a Montech AIR 903 Base case, The case has 9 fans in including the the 3 for the AIO. I have the GPU mounted traditionally, there are two intake case fans just below the GPU, 3 intake in the front of the case, 1 rear extraction and fan, the the 3 fans for the AIO extracting. The hottest I've seen the GPU is 59 degrees celsius testing with Cyberpunk.Now I only have one LG 4k C2 43" monitor at the moment, waiting for them to go on sale again to get the other two to complete the sim setup.  I have an adapter from display port to HDMI, then a good quality 8k HDMI cable from the adapter to tv.Once in a while I will have the sound and black screen for a split second, more annoying than anything else. Does it frequently with Cyberpunk and infrequently with sim racing with everything max out. Still investigating why. I do not hear any coil whine that some reported, but that might be my hearing not as good as it used to be.Cons: Did not come with a support bracket, luckily my case did, it was sagging and needs a brace.Lastly and this is nothing to do with the card this is more on Amazon and Nvidia, you're supposed to get a coupon code for a free game, "Get Overwatch2 with select GeForce RTX 40", never received my coupon, game would have been more my son than myself and would have been nice, supposed to be free. Amazon customer support have no idea what I'm talking about, supposed to be supplied by retailer, checked junk mail etc, nothing, they just keep referring me to Nvidia who refer me back to retailer.Not a huge issue but would have been nice and keep my son happy.
Ordered a “New” card, was sent a used card and on top of that, the card in the box wasn’t even the card ordered. Took a extra week to sort out and replace but it’s finally in and done. Excellent card.. ITS BIG, and does what its supposed to! GAME! Overall happy, just initial excitement was  turned to trash on first opening so replacement card wasn’t as exciting 😑On phone with customer service they got it sorted and sent a return label but it was at Kohl’s… no where near me so was a hassle to return, but overall:Product: 10/10customer service: 9/10
The media could not be loaded.Can’t beat it best gpu you can get
Bought June 6th 2023, $1988 from amazon directly.This card is great no driver or stability issues so far. More FPS, much less FAN noise. Came well packaged from amazon with the retail box inside of another box. The retail box was in perfect condition. It replaced a 6900xt and was an upgrade all around except for one minor annoyance.It has coil whine. It was incredibly annoying the first 2 weeks and I thought about returning. Worst whine I have ever heard in the ~16 cards I have owned in the last ~20 years. However, through magic or luck I feel like it "burned in" and the noise went from OMG WTF is this, to barely distinguishable over my fans running at 50%. I heard a rumor that might happen, so I planned to return before 30 days if it didn't go away. Lucky for me it did.Also, I want to emphasize this card is heavy. It comes with an included support that doubles as a screwdriver for the card. Flip it one way it is a screwdriver, other way rubber stopper to hold up card. Pretty nifty design. Has magnet on bottom to stay firmly in place while you position the card. Adjustable scroll wheel to raise or lower the rubber stopper to position. You will need to use the included support or buy a separate one. There is no chance you could use it without a support. Zero.I am happy with the purchase right now. If I have any issues, I will surely update this review, for $1988 at time of purchase, anything less than working as expected is unacceptable.
The media could not be loaded.This gpu is high quality, looks super nice and the performance is great. I’m and able to run ultra 4k on pretty much anything and get over 100 fps on most games. I’ve been playing Apex legends and I’m getting about 300 fps. I’m not sure if I lucked out but I dont have coil whine either. Also this thing is BIG so make sure your case is big enough, I had bought a Lian Li Evo rgb and had to exchange it for the Evo XL because the gpu cable was pushing up against the glass. One thing I wish this gpu had is more rgb and rgb the bottom by the fans.
De acuerdo a la descripción
Nvidia really blew the previous gen 3090Ti out of the water with this thing. With over 70% raw performance gain over the 3090Ti, the 4090 is the first card I've experienced that can actually deliver practical 4k gaming at max settings while maintaining acceptable FPS.Thermals on this thing are insanely good as well with the card averaging around 66-68c at 99% gaming load while maintaining relatively quiet operation. It actually runs cooler than my 14900k on avg. Only expected from such a humongous cooler.With DLSS frame gen on, can completely max Cyberpunk 2077 with DLSS set to quality at 3440x1440p ultrawide at well over 120 fps average paired with a i9 14900k.One major thing to be aware of is how absolutely huge and heavy this card is. This thing was so big I had to flip around my AIO to a front mount to properly fit it in my open bay TT P3 case. Before purchasing this behemoth, just make sure your PC case can even fit this thing. If doing a traditional horizontal mount, this thing absolutely requires an anti-sag bar to not damage the card/mobo long term. You can literally hear the mobo flexing if you don't have any anti sag support on this card.
I purchased this card more than year ago to put in my dream PC, paired with an i9 13900k, 64GB of DDR5 Ram, and a 1200W PSU.  Everything was perfect, at least on the surface.  This RTX 4090 was the missing piece of the puzzle and when it arrived I took it home and treated it like I would my own child, installed it that evening and fired up the machine.  That first day, everything felt perfect.  But after that day, the card suffered stability issues, constantly throwing black screens, ramping up the fans to 100%, and occasionally even throwing full artifact glitches across my screen on boot.  I fought the card for a year, updating firmwares and softwares, scanning Nvidia's website and ASUS's website for solutions and fixes, and tried everything without physically touching the card to fix it.  Last week I finally gave up and sent it back to ASUS on a Warranty claim RMA, and today they finally sent back notification that they're just replacing the card entirely.  From my research across the web, the 4090 has a pretty significant defect rate.  I can't recommend to anyone to spend $2,000 of their hard earned money on a paperweight, so thus, I can't recommend this product despite having bought it myself.  It's been a headache and a heartache, and ASUS made it quite difficult to pursue a warranty claim.
The media could not be loaded.I thought it was a waste of money but in reality this thing is going to last me for many years and I don't think I'll need another GPU anytime soon and I don't think I'll need another GPU anytime soon when I have this much computing power to play games
Spectacular, I have jumped from a strix 3080, to this strix 4090, it has less coilwhine (almost nothing, very low) and I love that, it is very cold (it does not exceed 50c in load while playing)I have it with a corsair rm1200x shift, 7950x3d, an O11 Dynamic Razer edition (I had to buy the VG4-4-V2X vertical bracket), it came with the updated 12v-2x6 connector (H++), also with the vertical bracket the cable stayed straight10/10 recommended
The card works well, a bit wider than I expected so a 90 degree adapter was needed to fit the front panel back on my case (NZXT H9 Flow)
cba to return it, and all seems good just theres noticeable coil whine. have seen others mention this too, so I dont think its just mine
So far the card has exceeded expectations!it's a 4090 doing 4090 things.scored a 27k in 3dmark TimeSpyHas a massive annoying coil whine.. Unfortunate.Definitely not worth the money.Just buy a 4080 super..
Installed went smooth on an asus z790-h motherboard. Because of the metal slot on this board, GPU does not sag at all even though it's quite heavy, once the slot part is screwed in.Got around 34,700 in cinebench 2024 gpu test. More than double my old 3080's 14,400.Only using 3 PCI-E 8 pin connectors, card only drew 260 watts max in cinebench 2024 gpu test, 3 connectors gets you 450 watts. 4 pins gets you 600 watts and is only needed for (extreme?) overclocking.Paired with a 13900KS, it got 90 fps in starfield in the cities, 1440p ultra no downscaling/fsr, depending on area. I thought I was happy with my 55 fps I was getting on my old 3080, the experience was miles better getting 90 fps in the cities. This gpu gets around 150 fps in interiors.Great card I would recommend it. I gave it 5 stars, except 4/5 on price, 1700 is a bit much, but if you can afford it and gaming is your passion, I would definitely get it.
Llego rapido y muy bien empacado lo recomiendo 100%
I absolutely love this card. The graphics are fast and sharp. I can run all modern games at the highest graphics settings with ease. I would also like to mention how quiet it is. At idle you cannot here it and under a load you can hear the fans running but it is still on the quiet side. I would buy this again.
Muy rápida, muy buena tarjeta físicamente hablando, buena construcción, solida.
The cards whine; this isn't a secret. When I first installed the card, it was really hissing during DOOM Eternal, but then summer hit and my AC easily drowned out any PC noise.Fast-forward to now, the fall, and even during Blender renders (during which the rapid power oscillation tend to make all cards scream), the TUF 4090 is no louder than my EVGA 3070 Ti (which was a very quiet card in my experience).I would NOT rely on a card's coil whine "getting better" - from my understanding that should not happen and doesn't really make any sense, but... anecdotally, that's what happened to me. YMMV
I am playing red dead redemption 2, cyberpunk 2077 and gta 5 at 4K ultra everything over 144 fps most of the time and never below 100fps in any of this games without breaking a sweat. This card is a beast like not just for todays games but for the future games as well. I am in love with this card. I didn’t notice any weird coil noise like some reviews mentioned so I am guessing they might have got a bad card but thank god the one I got is perfect. It all comes with a steel stand so you the support with the other end of the card since this card is hugeee like really big and heavy so make sure your case is good size I have fractal design torrent mid size. Also forgot to mention I also have 13900k nothing is over clocked. What I like the best about this combination is I can play games at 4K with 4K video rendering in the background at the same time while recording games as well so this is truly a multitasking beast combined with 13900k.
Seller shipped card faster than estimated ship date. Card arrived in original box in good condition with seals intact. Paid a premium for the card, but it's weeks later and the MSRP cards are still out of stock, so I'm glad I did as I'd still be waiting. The card itself is so powerful there is no need to OC. It run cool in the 50s or 60s at stock clocks and 95%+ utilization. There's nothing too special about it other than the fact that it simply tears through any game you throw at it. Games I've tried with DLSS3 are stupid fast. The new Plague Tail runs at 120-140 fps at max settings @ 4K and the graphics in that game are substantial. Games that used to tax the 3090 this card replaced run 100-120+ FPS and play much smoother. GPU pricing these days is wacked, but if you can find this card at MSRP then I'd call it a good buy. I looked for weeks with no luck, so I bit the bullet and just picked the seller with the lowest price (relatively speaking) and good reviews on Amazon thinking Amazon would support the sale if anything went wrong. This seller exceeded expectations by shipping quicker than the best estimated date. A good experience all around.
I bought this card specially for VR gaming purpose. Also to take advantage of my 4K Display.Great performance!Use this with a good PSU, ~1000W recommended.
Funciona muy bien
Other than it's gigantic size (not out of the ordinary for a 4090), the thing that stands out about this card is the extremely loud coil whine. Seriously -- it's audible from outside the room with the case panels on. I experienced the coil whine in both benchmarks (3DMark Time Spy + Port Royal), and in gaming (Cyberpunk max settings + path tracing, hogwarts legacy + ray tracing). It's so bad that wearing headphones is a necessity.Something else worth mentioning is that this card performed below average on benchmarks compared to  other 4090s at its stock configuration. However, one point in favour of this card is that it is very overclockable. I submitted a Port Royale result with +260 core and +1600 memory, netting a 10.8% higher score: 24953 -> 27515.Ultimately, I returned the card and purchased one from a different manufacturer whos 4090 was known to have less coil whine.
He ben my friend since 2012. i met him on Call of duty Black ops 2 in a random multiplayer lobby when xbox 360 was a thing. He was my online  friend then and in 2023 his my brother now.His new GPU bottle neck but that mostly because his power support and CPU. Not the best.. but better then before.his pc wouldn't start that's Reason I bought him this card. His last card quit on him. Had a AMD Radeon RX 6800 he always wanted a Nivdia but it just too expensive. where he have to pay on house,power,water and basic needs. His once powerful tower was collecting dust because he didn't have money may up for a new RX 6800 one. So 5 months later his birthday came up and I told him if had unlimited money what graphics card would you get. He pick the the ASUS ROG strix RTX 4090 OC edition. It didn't help that he know more about graphics card alittle more then I and he got one with best stats so rip wallet lol 😅 nah very wholesome moment.. I do it again if I had too.
This think was A very nice upgrade from My 3090 ti FE. More so for the beauty in my white build but the power and boost in FPS are very noticeable. Definitely want to use the included support that comes with it cause this thing is a monster.
Una placa para jigar y licir a tope
I bought this card because my 3070 was just not cutting it. This thing works and I can now play games with very nice looking graphic quality. I have had no need to overclock anything just yet. I will need to buy a new CPU long before over locking this card.Pros: very fast and chugs through any work you put in front of itCons: Very loud. Ever since I got this graphics card my computer has been noticably louder.
Best card on the market currently, pricey but worth every penny, I'm using it with AMD's 7950X3D and it shreds games and editing tasks with no problems.Make sure to buy a full tower case with lots of free space and room to move around stuff, this card is MASSIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you're looking for an affordable computer case that can fit this graphics card option with lots of room I recommend you buy this one, so much room and space to install parts.Antec Performance 1 FT, Full Tower, RTX40 Fully Compatible, Temp Display, 4 x Storm T3 PWM Fans, Type-C, Dual TG Side Panels, Removable Top Bracket, High Airflow Mesh Front Panel, E-ATX PC Gaming Case
The media could not be loaded.Gaming at 4k is great! Temps are average 60 degree. The GPU does come with a sag stand but you don't really need it but with the weight of this card using it gives you a peace of mind. There was a slight coil whine one time gaming but it never came back again. I game about 1 to 3 hrs a day. Thanks reading
This card is very big and heavy. It is longer than the founders addition so make sure you do your homework to make sure your tower can fit it.  I didn’t and had to do some slight adjusting of one of my fans that you see vertically since the card was so long and would not slot into my motherboard unless I moved the fan that was in the way by a quarter of an inch.The card is very powerful and better at maintaining my fps at 4k resolution on a 55 inch monitor than my 3090FE. Card is also very pretty with the lightning.I would say my only con is the $2k+ price but that’s just the way of things with these high end gpus where I went with this over the 4090FE since it’s faster and runs cooler.
What's not to like? Oodles of power which makes most of my games run like butter. Not much that I can add that hasn't been stated by others on here. Make sure you have an ATX 3.0 power supply for this beast (it'll need it). Avoid ATX 2.0 and lower. No coil whine noticed with my card. Been running for a month now and I have zero complaints in that aspect. Biggest complaint is that it's a bit overpriced... but that's nVidia for ya. But I went from RTX 2080ti to this behemoth and... yeah. Also upgraded my system from i9-10900k to 13900k, DDR5, etc. It's been a breathtakingly delicious upgrade that I've been enjoying. If you got the money (or can afford the 12mo spread out payments), I can't recommend this enough. It's sure to last for YEARS.
The media could not be loaded.After having owned an ASUS ROG strix RTX 3090 white, I decided to take the plunge and move up to the 4090 White Edition. Let me tell you why this was the right thing to do.First, cable management is no longer an issue because you only have the one small connector.This thing's cooling is unbelievable. Under full load not once did the card hit 60C.  ASUS as always did an outstanding job with their cooling solution.Unlike the 3090, this huge graphics card has Republic of gamers in lights which makes it fit my all ASUS rig so much better.It demolishes all games pretty much max settings at 4K. It is beautiful, it is quiet, and it is a must-have if you can afford it.Is it overpriced?  Yeah.  But it's well worth it, Join the Republic!
These are finally often in stock from Amazon and not scalpers.The performance on this GPU in terms of FPS is insane.  It also runs very cool, playing cyberpunk I think the temps are typically between 55-60C.  Memory and hotspot temps are also a few degrees cooler than the founders edition.But unfortunately for me in terms of noise I had to return this.  Most reviewers have this card pegged as the quietest of the AIBs, and they are probably right if you don't get any coil whine, but oh man I got insane coil whine from this card.  It was so bad that you can hear the whine over the fans.  I also was able to pickup the 4090 FE which I had to return for the same reason.From what I read the whine is more common on certain AIBs and can be exacerbated with certain GPU/PSU/Mobo combinations.  If this helps I have an ASUS Crosshair Viii dark hero motherboard and ASUS TUF 1000W Gold ATX 3.0 PSU.Tbh, you could probably drown out the whine by upping the fans by playing around with fan curves, but to me that seems like an unnecessary step for something that cost 2k.Ended up with the 4090 Aorus Master, ZERO coil whine.
Was a bit worried buying this at such a close price to MSRP but considering it’s from amazon itself I was fine even if it was a scan thanks to RMA’s. Only issue I had was an initial scare to death because my pc wouldn’t detect the 4090. Make sure to install new drivers for the 4090 if you’re like me and you upgraded from a 1080ti. I freaked out and almost thought i got a lemon.Graphics card already performs incredibly well like wow. I mainly use it for DCS World in VR for my flight simulation needs.
Buyers beware this card is very large yes im sure you are saying 'well duh' but if you dont know you've been warned by the photo of this vs my 3080ti. However after turning my system on with the new card holy lord this thing is a beast out of the box during stress tests in the oc mode i waa seeing 2700+ on the core with very solid 50-60c temps after pushing it some more i was able to get 2950 under stress test relatively easy and stable while still only seeing 55-65c temps anything higher would run for a bit but then crash. Everything is running maxed out on 3440x1440 and its great maybe not a worthy upgrade for many etc etc but if you want to push your games to higher fps and fidelity go for this card!
Bought this with EK back & front active water cooling block. Runs at 36 degrees Celsius on load. Still to this day, I'm afraid my GPU is going to fry due to pollutants in the power connectors, still hasn't happened.I'm a software engineer and have been designing a really efficient game engine over the years in C/C++ using Vulkan. Currently the Windows build will get ~4000 FPS. On Arch Linux using the proprietary driver it will run at 9000+ FPS. Granted the engine isn't running much but a few models, a skybox, and misc. gui.Excellent workstation card. Price is quite steep though.
Make sure you have plenty of space for this one. I have a Corsair 4000D airflow, and it just barely fits. It is gloriously beautiful though.
I use this card for some of my machine learning training. It's working great! It's also very fast for gaming, but I mostly use it for the machine learning. If you just want gaming, a cheaper card might be better, but as the 4090 is great for both gaming and AI workloads, it's perfect for me.
Coil whine is definitely an issue with these cards.But nothing I can't tune out with the sound of my fans roaring. Sounds like my computer case is ready to take flight.Now, you have to worry about power delivery. If you don't have a native PSU that routes 12VHPWR cables from the GPU to PSU; you have a problem. I'd recommend 4x 8-pin or 3x 8-pin since 8-pin is rated for 150w average to 200w peaks.As for the cable melt issues? Check your cable and force it in a bit more just in case. You can reduce the odds of melt by grabbing more premium cables. Yes, you can try Cablemod as long as you follow these following things: Modflex cables, aluminum heatsink over connector, Direct PSU Replacement cables [don't add more joints to the cable. this adds resistance which translates into heat.], and lastly please do not buy the 90-deg adapter from them.
I recently purchased the ASUS TUF RTX 4090 from Amazon, and I'm very pleased with my purchase. The graphics card is extremely powerful and efficient, and it really shows in all the games I've been playing. It's also very well-built, with a solid aluminum heatsink to keep it cool and quiet. The card also has plenty of ports for multiple displays, and I haven't had any issues with it. I would definitely recommend this graphics card for anyone looking for a powerful card that won't break the bank.
It's better than everything else out there, but when I look at the performance metrics on sites, they make it look like this will blow everything else away in a very noticeable increase. I didn't find that to be true with most modern games. I got maybe a 20% increase in FPS and quality compared to my old 2080ti
This thing is a beast! Almost needed a forklift to get it in! But I am playing Metro Exodus in 4k with settings on ultra and it's buttery smooth! Couldn't be happier.
I purchased this ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4090 OG OC Edition, and it went bad in just two months. When I contacted support, they RMA'd the card and later told me it was unrepairable. Instead of fixing or sending me a new one, they sent me a completely different card that looked worn out but assured me it was from the manufacturer. The tamper seal on top was even gone. Worse, they refused to let me get a second opinion on my original card and said the exchange was part of a process I had supposedly agreed to—but none of this was ever explained to me upfront.Throughout the entire ordeal, no one from ASUS support was helpful or willing to work with me on this terrible replacement. They seemed more interested in forcing their shady practices than providing real support. I feel ripped off, and my advice is to avoid ASUS entirely. Their lack of transparency and customer care is alarming, and dealing with their support has been a nightmare. Good luck if you decide to go with them—you’ll probably need it.
As you have seen from other reviews - the card is massive so you need to make sure there is plenty of room in your case. Upgraded to the Asus Strix 4090 OC from a Zotac OC and in 3D Mark the difference was around 2,000 points towards the Asus Stix 4090 OC. Definitely impressive performance and build. My only negative impressive in the "peg" to support the card from bending the case. Basically an inverted screwdriver which was a tight fit in the case. I ended up ordering https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08S2RWY9F to help support the card from bending. Note - the Antec Graphics card support brace was also a very tight fight to hold the Asus 4090 OC card but it did fit with a bit of back/forth adjustments.
I love this card!  I went all out on my custom, system build. ASUS Hero Max mother. 128 GB Cosair, 8 strip Led Cosair lights, Power Supply 1600 watt Cosair, (4) Samsung SSD 1 TB drives, (4) WD 4 TB Sata Drive, (5) M2 Drives, Intel I9-12900 Raptor,The card runs a cooler than my ASUS 3090 24GB
Got this for a really good deal :) My only issue is that its super unstable when gaming, but it works like a dream when my whole system doesnt crash LOL
Love this card.  It is a beast.  It is a monster physically compared to my 3080Ti that I had.  10k additional points on my 3dmark TimeSpy scores.  I took one point away because I paid for priority shipping @ a $42 upcharge and it took 7 days to get here.  The seller used USPS from El Paso Texas and was going to Oklahoma!  Seems very "NOT" Priority and especially for $42.  Doesn't appear to be a way to complain about it and get a shipping refund.  Other than that,  card is well worth the money I spent.
It is a great card but make sure it will fit your case.
I’m so impressed by the visual renderings of MSFS 2020! The flight SIM is unbelievably smooth and the cardceasiky handkes 3x 4k monitirs with FPS in the high 90s. The RTX 4090 OC 24 GB is so much better then the card it replaced AMD Radeon 6700 XT.
Believe the hype. This card is awesome. Make sure you have enough space in your case because this card is over a foot long. It stays fairly cool and runs quiet. Yes, it will separate you from a lot of those dollar bills but, that's the price for awesomeness.
This is not for everyone however it was totally worth every penny to me love the card would buy again its stupid fast i waterblocked it soon as i got it runs cool and fast in my set up running 1440p with a 13900k most games are maxed settings getting well over 165 fps with ease
The media could not be loaded.After seeing the review about the faulty card and the one that received a 4080 instead of a 4090 i was concerned, but when i received my and installed it i was so impressed with it. There's a small coil whine when the fans are att full speed but with the case closed you can barely hear it and honestly when u put on the headphones to play you wont hear a thing. I totally recomment this GPU. MW2 with 4k and ultra settings the fps doesnt drop under 170 and forza horizon 5 ranges between 220 to 240 which is beyond amazing.
Obviously the best GPU on the market right now.  Far more quiet than the previous generation, and runs much cooler as well.  Make sure you have a descent PSU to keep things going, I recommend a 1200 Watt.  DLSS 3 is a great improvement over DLSS 2 and can make a quite an improvement in frame rates in games that support it.  Get ahold of GPU Tweak III and you can play around with overclocking the GPU some.  The memory however, just can't seem to handle overclocking at all.
Generally I got what I paid for. The card has worked fine so far, with some coil whine sometimes (but not too much). It is really massive but I managed to place it inside my Asus AP201 case, with a evga g7 1000W PSU. It seems now prices of some models are going down, but I got it at MSRP sold by Amazon.
Best card on the market.  Stays cool and quiet under load from Starfield at 2k ultra.  Understated look, which appeals to me, without an excess of RGB.  It's huge though, so make sure your case can accommodate it.  Unfortunately it costs more than 3 next Gen consoles, but should keep up with anything that comes out for a couple generations.
I haven’t had time to test it as I just received the gpu so I can’t give an entirely accurate rating, but, for such and expensive graphics card sold as new, I kind of expected it to arrive in its original packaging and not a generic cardboard box with an esd bag that can’t fit the thing.
This thing is just a beast to make the review as simple as possible. 1200 fps on fortnjte with the right settings in the control panel.
It fits in the 2000D Corsair lol. Beast of a card
It weights 4.96 pounds (almost 2.5Kg) which is just brutal. I bought it and stripped the air cooling right out of the box to fit a Waterblock for my system so I can't speak for stock noise levels since mine are 0db. In terms of performance for 4K gaming, it's what you can expect from this generation and more. Price still feels steep though.
as expected, it is awesome. Fan wasn't loud for me and gpu temp is pretty good.One bad thing about it is that the gpu makes my case bit hotter than before(was using 3060) so my avg cpu temp also increased a bit. Now I can actually feel the heat coming out from my desktop case LOL. Glad I bought a portable AC few months ago so my room won't be a sauna.
It didn't come with anything but the GPU itself. Which is fine really I didn't want to use an adapter so I bought cosairs (my psu) cable. Works like a charm.
A beast of a machine
It is simply the best. I had to a new case and a new motherboard (I need an available pcie-16 x4) but who cares. This card is simply amazing. I will forever be spoiled. The only drawbacks are its size and price. Some will say you don't "need" a card like this. Then again you don't "need" a Ferrari to drive on the highway but if you have one you couldn't care less what anyone else says. You have the best.
Great card bought it before the second price hike and WW3, Thankfully. Just a little advice get a support for it, it's heavy
Has worked amazingly and preformed even better with extended gaming sessions. I have not heard any cool wind and seems to be pretty quiet for the most part.
* I have modified this RTX4090 with EK ABP water block and liquid metal TIM (use with proper electric insulation like polyurethane on resistors surrounding the GPU).* I use Corsair 12VHPWR cable instead of that one provided with RTX4090.The performance is insanely good, perfect combo with 4K 144Hz monitors, smooth with even highest graphics quality settings in most games. My PC is now throttled by CPU performance (3900X), I will have to upgrade my CPU for even better gaming experience.
New pc build
2K simply won’t cut it anymore. This heavy duty card absolutely tears through anything you throw at it. Cyberpunk 2077 with Path Tracing will change your life. Very pleasant to look at in your machine, and the packaging comes loaded with fun extras. Great for AI too.
This badboy is silent, stays cool and powers through anything I ask it to do.  Paired with an i9-10900k, they make a great duo.  Refusing to move to e cores, I still get amazing performance with anything.  Gorgeous card also.  If you want the best, this is the one to get.
Card had an obvious(?) manufacturing defect/damage. Packaging was not damaged and the item was unopened. For a premium caliber card at a premium price this is unacceptable - plus it could be indicative of other problems with the card. It would have been nice to get a partial refund but that wasn't an option. Either Quality Control missed this card, or they don't consider this a problem (and the customer won't notice).Note: Given the highly touted cooling mechanisms (eg. vapor chamber) which ASUS has put in place, invasive damage to the cooling fins indicating potential weakening of the chamber/pipes was a definite concern.
It's expensive but it's the best what do you expect
Couldn’t find a 4090 Founders Edition card at MSRP so settled on this card for $150 more than an FE and I am not disappointed. The build quality is excellent, the card is a cool, silent beast allowing me to play most of my games at 4K 100-120fps @ max graphics settings without this card breaking a sweat, can hardly even hear the fans and no coil wine. Oh and it also comes with a GPU support brace.
Got my 4090 in 1 day shipping! Amazing fast, excellent card...Since im using it in an older RYZEN ... I had a bit of problems with syncronization of the Sound with Video....I had to upgrade the BIOS to my motherboard...and the card is working flawless now! Im loving it! I will upgrade my CPU a bit later...but for now this will work....so always make sure you UPDATE THE BIOS! :)Great seller for fast shipping!
This is the ferrari of the GPU's. It is great playing cyberpunk at 100 FPS at 4k on the highest settings. Can't really say much about the fastest GPU on the market. Though it is the best, it definitely comes at a price tag that will break the bank ... 2k. Honestly i'd go for the normal models as you will save over 400 usd.
Card works like a dream!  I play on an ultra wide 5120 x 1440 monitor and I can play anything an ultra with ray tracing at 100fps or more.One thing to be aware of is the massive size of the card. It took some clever planing to make it fit in my corsair 5000d airflow.
I got the new card. It installed without issues. Getting the Asus Armory Crate working is bad. Asus Armory Crate is as bad as any vendors proprietary software. I have Asus MB but had to uninstall and reinstall completely to get it to detect and control lights. About typical from my Asus software experience.  Card seemed to work well until under heavy load.3rd fan when running has all signs of bad bearings, grinding and shaking at lower speeds, squealing and shaking at high speeds. For a premium card the vendor did not fully testing the card post assembly is a bad sign.Amazon would not allow me to order replacement. Amazon even if defective would only offer return for refund. Talking with customer service they were not able to allow to reorder. After return will purchase from another website.For a day 1 failure I'll not try Asus warranty. No reason to risk getting a refurbished / repaired card and going through days to week of hassle with warranty service.
Expensive for gpu’s but the price matches performance and more. Came from 7900xt (great product for price). While not running to its full potential, still runs ahead of the current generation and past it. Quiet, power efficient and powerful. Just double check to make sure it fits your case and that you understand how to use 12vh pwr connector properly.
Great product, vendor very helpful and communicative, highly recommended.Product came as described and on time!!!
getting 390-600 frames on valorant, played forza horizon 5, rdr2 on max setting and the temp doesn't go above 50. for the price you are paying, you're expecting no issues. and it delivers towards your expectation. i would def recommend since its the cheapest (retail lol, 1599) compared to the oc and other brands, plus if you got a asus motherboard, you can sync colors pretty easily
